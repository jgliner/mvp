# PocketBonanza #
#### A competitive Internet scavenger hunt for the easily-amused ####

PocketBonanza challenges friends to scour the internet in search of the most fitting answer to a given prompt (e.g. "Coolest Music Video" or "Weirdest Thing You Have in Your Pocket Right Now"). Each prompt has an appropriate time limit, making sure that you don't stress about the "perfect response". When time is up, everyone's answer is revealed, and each user will have 24 hours to vote on the most fitting picture or video.

##### The Problem #####
We've gotten to a point in Internet history where it is difficult to share cool/funny/amusing/strange things with friends without having them respond "hahaha seen it... so funny", or something similar. In other words, we've been "following the crowd" instead of thinking critically when it comes to boredom.

##### The Solution #####
Challenge yourself to take your distractions more seriously in PocketBonanza! "hahaha seen it... so funny" will show up in your chats much less frequently, and you'll be better connected with your friends as a result.

> "Last time I played PocketBonanza with my friends, Mike posted [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FavUpD_IjVY) when the category was "That Weird Part of YouTube". Needless to say, I had to have a discussion with him about where on earth he found that.
